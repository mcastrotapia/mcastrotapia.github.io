  Photo by Mark Garlick / University of Warwick. We investigate crystallization-driven convection in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. We present a version of the mixing length theory that self-consistently includes the effects of thermal diffusion and composition gradients, and provides solutions for the convective parameters based on the local heat and composition fluxes.

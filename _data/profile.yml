    Hi! I'm a PhD student in Physics at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca" target="_blank">McGill University</a> since August 2022. I work on computational modeling of the structure and evolution of white dwarf stars, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cumming" target="_blank">Prof. Andrew Cumming</a>.
    My research combines concepts of phase transitions, fluid dynamics, and magnetic fields to investigate convection and crystallization in white dwarf stars.
    Previously, I pursued my undergraduate studies in Astronomy in my home country at <a href="https://www.uc.cl/" target="_blank">Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile </a>, where I investigated the lithium abundance and radial velocity variabilities of red giant stars under the supervision of <a href="https://claudiaaguileragomez.com" target="_blank">Prof. Claudia Aguilera-Gómez</a> and <a href="https://cata.cl/en/integrante/julio-cesar-chaname-dominguez" target="_blank">Prof. Julio Chanamé</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy playing music, drawing, painting, and visiting natural landscapes.
